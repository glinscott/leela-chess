/// xorshift64star Pseudo-Random Number Generator
/// This class is based on original code written and dedicated
/// to the public domain by Sebastiano Vigna (2014).
/// It has the following characteristics:
///
///  -  Outputs 64-bit numbers
///  -  Passes Dieharder and SmallCrush test batteries
///  -  Does not require warm-up, no zeroland to escape
///  -  Internal state is a single 64-bit integer
///  -  Period is 2^64 - 1
///  -  Speed: 1.60 ns/call (Core i7 @3.40GHz)
///
/// For further analysis see
///   <http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/xorshift.pdf>
