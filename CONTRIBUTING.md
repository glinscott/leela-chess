# Contributing to LCZero

First, thanks for taking the time to contribute, and read this!

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome!  But, to make things easier for everyone, there are some basic guidelines:
- Keep the change minimal.
- Provide a description of the change, the expected result, and what tests you've run.
- Avoid refactoring/renaming things at the same time as functional changes.
- If the change is not functional, the bench should match on the same version of the network.

## Conduct

- Please be respectful of others at all times
